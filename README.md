# Mentors Without Borders

Mentors without Borders is an application made for individuals who are seeking mentors to help guide them in any specific field. It's also for anyone who has the desire to take a mentorship role and help the mentee grow and gain more knowledge in a certain expertise. What makes our application different is that we integrated tools where users are able to communicate with a voice / text language translator so that he/she does not have to worry about the language barriers.
